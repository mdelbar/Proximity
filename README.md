Proximity
=========
iPhone app for Proximity

Currently allows the user some basic information (which is as of yet disregarded when searching).
Shows users that are "near" the current location (near metric found in the server project).

ToDo
----
- Use the user information and preferences to actually filter "near" users
- Improve design and app flow (fix some UI bugs)
- Long-term: background mode (buzz/ping when you walk past someone else that fits your search parameters)
